The pipeline is structured across three Jupyter notebooks, each serving a distinct phase in the data processing journey: Bronze for extraction and loading, Silver for cleaning and transformation, and Gold for aggregation and analysis. This guide provides a detailed overview of the pipeline's purpose, the underlying architecture, and the analytical insights it aims to deliver.</p>\n<h2><span>Ⅱ.</span> Overview</h2>\n<p>The burgeoning volume of data generated by platforms like Airbnb presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, this data harbors valuable insights into market dynamics, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. On the other, realizing this potential necessitates robust data engineering pipelines that can process, clean, and analyze data at scale. Our solution harnesses the power of Azure Databricks, a cloud-based Big Data analytics platform, to construct a scalable ETL pipeline segmented into three strategic layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.</p>\n<h3>The Three-Tier Architecture</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bronze Notebook</strong>: Focuses on data extraction and loading. Raw data from Airbnb listings, calendar details, and GeoJSON files are ingested and stored as Parquet files. This layer serves as the data lake's raw zone, where data is kept in its original form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Silver Notebook</strong>: Dedicated to data cleaning and transformation. Here, data undergoes deduplication, normalization, and enrichment. Erroneous records are corrected or removed, and data is transformed into a structured format suitable for analytical queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gold Notebook</strong>: Centers on data aggregation and analysis. The refined data is modeled into a star schema, facilitating complex analytical queries and insights. This notebook produces the final analytical tables and views, enabling data visualization and reporting.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span>Ⅲ.</span> Key Components and Technologies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Azure Databricks</strong>: Serves as the core platform for developing and running our ETL pipeline, offering a managed Spark environment that simplifies processing Big Data workloads.</li>\n<li><strong>Delta Lake</strong>: A storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads, ensuring data integrity across our pipeline.</li>\n<li><strong>Spark SQL and DataFrames</strong>: Utilized for data manipulation and queries, enabling efficient data transformation and analysis within Databricks notebooks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Ⅳ.</span> Insights and Analytics</h2>\n<p>The culmination of our ETL pipeline is the generation of actionable insights derived from Airbnb data. By analyzing listings across various neighbourhoods and temporal dimensions, we uncover trends related to pricing strategies, occupancy rates, and host performance. These insights can inform stakeholders on market positioning, investment opportunities, and operational improvements.</p>\n<h2><span>Ⅴ.</span> Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This ETL pipeline exemplifies the fusion of modern data engineering practices with cloud-based analytics to harness the full potential of Airbnb's extensive datasets. By structurally organizing the data processing workflow into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, we ensure scalability, maintainability, and accessibility of data. The insights generated from this pipeline not only empower decision-makers with actionable intelligence but also underscore the strategic value of data in the competitive landscape of short-term rental markets.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Azure Databricks, ADLS Gen2 Pipeline","stack":"Pyspark & Spark SQL & Delta Lake & ADLS","images":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/ba492/ad0.png","srcSet":"/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/9dba3/ad0.png 343w,\n/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/32fc7/ad0.png 686w,\n/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/ba492/ad0.png 1371w","sizes":"(min-width: 1371px) 1371px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/57bcc/ad0.webp 343w,\n/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/d5b30/ad0.webp 686w,\n/static/e5d654a736ef5c5c53d9d5811d6a172f/7c07b/ad0.webp 1371w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1371px) 1371px, 100vw"}]},"width":1371,"height":478}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"azure-databricks-etl"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1732862183","1965041683"],"slicesMap":{}}
