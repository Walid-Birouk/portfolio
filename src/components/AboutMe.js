          Originally from the beautiful coast of Algeria, where I spent much of
          my youth free diving and fishing, I have always been drawn to
          exploring new depths—both in the sea and in technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My early fascination with gaming and computers blossomed into a
          passion for PC building and programming, leading me to pursue a
          bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Informatics (Software
          Engineering). However, driven by a desire for cutting-edge technology
          and a more satisfying career path, I sought opportunities beyond local
          limitations.

          This quest took me to Belgium, where I enrolled in an English AI
          course at Thomas More. It was here that I truly found my passion in
          the realm of Artificial Intelligence, particularly data processing. My
          recent internship at Algorhythm, focusing on Data Observability, has
          not only deepened my expertise in the modern data stack but also
          prepared me for a promising future as a data engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am eager to leverage my skills in state-of-the-art tools and
          practices to innovate and drive progress in the data field.
